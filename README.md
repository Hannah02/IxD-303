IXD301: Designing User Experiences

-[Proof that I did the Javascript thing cause I'm really proud cause coding is hard...](https://twitter.com/HannahLizSharp/status/829087025404006403)

-[User persona](http://hannahsharpblog.tumblr.com/post/160408188116/drizzzle-user-profile-while-talking-about-my-app)
This persona focuses on the group of young designers I want this app to be styled towards.

These prototypes show how simple my app is to use and the visual transitions that would be implamented if the app was actually created.

-[Style tile](http://hannahsharpblog.tumblr.com/post/160412020396/weather-app-style-tile-this-style-tile-shows-the)
This style tile sets the visual standards for the website promoting the app, and the app itself.

-[Branding](https://Hannah02.github.io/IxD-303/Branding.png) 
A parody of the dribbble logo, making fun of the fact that my target audience was basically Dribbble's user base.

After reading Dribbble's brand guidelines, I highly doubt they would ever green-light an app like this, even though it is done in parody, but it was a fun concept idea to play around with for this project.

-[App final site](https://Hannah02.github.io/IxD-303/DrizzzleSite/index.html)
This is the final site that advertises the app concept and links to a preliminary version of the app.
